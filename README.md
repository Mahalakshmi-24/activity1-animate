## How i install it

  * I'm very confused to select the library first.

  * After that i did activity using revealjs and i submitted it.

  * Afternoon labtime jessica give me this link to try an [animate](https://animate.style/).

  * i checked it and wanna try it, so i created another repo.

  * I use CDN link here.

## Demo implementation

  * I used some of the animate to animate text.

  *  Those are 

    - rotateInUpLeft

    - flipInX

    - bounce
    
    - slideInLeft

    - and i use delay 'animate__delay' to delay the animation
